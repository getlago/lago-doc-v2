  "In addition to the price of the plan, you can charge your customers for
  usage."

For instance, you can create charges based on the number of API calls, the
number of active users, transactions, compute time, etc. These additional
charges relate to the [billable metrics](/overview) defined previously.

## Overview of charges[](#overview-of-charges "Direct link to heading")

You can add charges to a plan by calling an existing billable metric. These
"pay-as-you-go" features can be linked to several plans.

<Info>
  - Charges are always paid in arrears as they are based on usage; 
  - Charges are denominated in the same currency as the plan; and 
  - The trial period does not apply to charges. The trial period only applies to the base amount of the plan.

</Info>

There are several price models available for charges (see below).

## Number of decimals[](#number-of-decimals "Direct link to heading")

Lago allows you create charges with up to fifteen decimals (e.g.
$0.000123456789123).

Please note that charges are invoiced in `amount_cents`. Therefore, Lago
automatically rounds prices (e.g. USD 1102 `amount_cents` \= $11.02).

## Charge models[](#charge-models "Direct link to heading")

### Standard charge model[](#standard-charge-model "Direct link to heading")

Select the standard charge model if you want to charge the **same price for each
unit** consumed.

Imagine that your API company charges $0.05 per API call (i.e. your billable
metric). By selecting the standard charge model, you will define a fixed unit
price. If a customer makes 1,000 API calls during the billing period, the total
invoice amount will be $0.05 x 1,000 API calls = $50.

### Graduated charge model[](#graduated-charge-model "Direct link to heading")

Select the graduated charge model if you want to define **several price tiers**.
This charge model allows you to apply a discount depending on the number of
units consumed. You can also apply a **flat fee** to an entire tier.

Let's take back the example of the API company. You could charge $1 per unit for
the first 100 units (first 100 API calls), then $0.50 per unit for the next 100
calls and finally, $0.10 for any additional unit.

Please refer to the tooltip in the user interface for more information.

### Package charge model[](#package-charge-model "Direct link to heading")

Select the package charge model if you want to apply a **fixed price to a range
of units**. You also have the ability to offer free units.

Let's take back the example of our API company. You may want to charge $5 per
100 units and offer the first 100 units. In this example, 201 units would cost
$0 (first 100 units) + $5 (next 100 units) + $5 (last unit) = $10.

### Percentage charge model[](#percentage-charge-model "Direct link to heading")

Select the percentage charge model if you want to apply a **percentage and a
fixed fee on transactions** (e.g. bank transfers, ATM withdrawals, etc.).

This charge model is generally used with billable metrics that allow users to
calculate the total amount of transactions (e.g. `sum` aggregation type and
`amount` defined as the event property -
[learn more](/aggregation-types#2-sum)).

You can define several parameters for the percentage charge model, including:

- **Percentage rate**: charge rate that applies to the total amount (e.g. 1.2%
  on transactions);
- **Fixed fee (optional)**: fee that applies to each event ingested during the
  billing period (e.g. $0.10 per transaction);
- **Free units (events - optional)**: number of events that are not subject to
  the fixed fee; and
- **Free units (total amount - optional)**: amount that is not subject to the
  charge rate.

When free units are defined for both the total amount and number of events, Lago
performs checks each time a new event is ingested to determine whether the free
units still apply. In the illustration below for instance, the first 3 events or
$500 are free.

![Configuration of the percentage charge model](/plans/images/percentage-model-b2657bc04ac57c27cfe3bc3b830fd8dc.png)

Consider the following list of events:

| Event         | Amount | Total number of events         | Total amount     | Result     |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Transaction 1 | $200   | 1 free event (out of 3)        | $200 ($500 free) | No charges |
| Transaction 2 | $100   | 2 free events (out of 3)       | $300 ($500 free) | No charges |
| Transaction 3 | $100   | 3 free events (out of 3)       | $400 ($500 free) | No charges |
| Transaction 4 | $50    | 4 events (free units exceeded) | $450 ($500 free) | Charge     |

Therefore, for the fourth transaction, the charge will be $0.10 x 1 event + 1.2%
of $50 = $0.70.

### Volume charge model[](#volume-charge-model "Direct link to heading")

Select the volume charge model if you want to define several price tiers but
want to apply a **single unit price based on the total volume**. You can also
apply a **flat fee** in addition to the unit price.

Consider the following example, where each unit represents an API call:

| Tier   | First unit | Last unit | Unit price | Fixed fee |
| ------ | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Tier 1 | 0          | 10,000    | $0.0010    | $10       |
| Tier 2 | 10,001     | 50,000    | $0.0008    | $10       |
| Tier 3 | 50,001     | 100,000   | $0.0006    | $10       |
| Tier 4 | 100,001    | âˆž         | $0.0004    | $10       |

In this case, 65,000 API calls would cost 65,000 x $0.0006 + $10 = $49.

## Delete charges[](#delete-charges "Direct link to heading")

You may delete a charge included in a plan associated with existing
[subscriptions](/plans/subscriptions).

If you do so and save the change:

- The charge will be immediately removed from all subscriptions linked to this
  plan;
- The charge will no longer be included in the
  [current usage](/api/customer-usage/customer-usage-object) of the customers
  concerned; and
- The charge will be immediately removed from all `draft` invoices associated
  with these subscriptions.

However, the charge will still be included in all `finalized` invoices
associated with these subscriptions.

<Info>
  Deleting a charge does not delete the events associated with the corresponding
  billable metric. If later you decide to add the charge back into the plan, the
  events received before the deletion may be taken into account in the billing
  process (depending on the limits of the billing period).
