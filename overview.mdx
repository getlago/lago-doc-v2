  "Billable metrics define how incoming events are aggregated in order to
  measure consumption."

If you want to charge your customers for the use of a particular feature, then
you should create the corresponding billable metric.

To add a new billable metric through the user interface:

- Enter its `name`;
- Assign it a `code` which will be used as the name of the event sent from your
  backend;
- Add a `description` _(optional)_; and
- Select the `aggregation type` which will define how consumption will be
  measured.

The next section describes the different
[aggregation types](/aggregation-types). In addition to this, we have added some
[examples](/aggregation-examples) to help you understand the relationship
between incoming events and billable metrics.
