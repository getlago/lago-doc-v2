  "By ingesting events, you can see them flowing in the Lago application by
  using the debugger. It allows you to take a deeper look at ingested events and
  detect possible warnings."

## Accessing the debugger[](#accessing-the-debugger "Direct link to heading")

You can access the event debugger from the UI by following this path:

1. Go to the **Developers** section in the sidebar;
2. Click the **Debugger** tab;
3. See a list of ingested events; and
4. Reload this list when you ingest new events.

By default, the UI shows you a list of the latest 20 events, but you can load
much more by scrolling down the page.

<Tip>If an event is not shown in the UI, it has **not** been ingested.</Tip>

## Accessing a specific event[](#accessing-a-specific-event "Direct link to heading")

In the debugger, by clicking on a specific event, you will have access to 2 main
blocks:

1. **A list of useful properties returned**
   - **Time:** timestamp of the received events;
   - **Customer ID:** the ID of your customer;
   - **Billable metric code:** code of the billable metric linked to the event;
   - **Billable metric name:** name of the billable metric linked to the event;
   - **Transaction ID:** unique `transaction_id` of the event used as
     idempotency key;
   - **IP Address:** IP address of the event sender; and
   - **Client API:** Lago Client API used to send the event.
2. **A JSON with event's arguments sent in the payload**

## Possible warnings[](#possible-warnings "Direct link to heading")

Some events can be ingested but triggering a bad or unexpected behavior. This is
why Lago displays in the UI two possible warnings:

1. The event `code` is **not related to an existing billable metric**; and
2. The billable metric's **property used for the aggregation is not sent**
   through this event.
