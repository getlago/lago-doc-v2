description: "Add-ons allow you to apply a one-off fee to a customer. When you apply an add-on
to a customer, it is invoiced immediately and eligible for collection straight
away."

For instance, add-ons can be used to apply one-time fees, such as a setup fee,
one-time payment or customer success fee.

<Info>
  The value of a coupon is **not** deducted from an add-on. For more
  information, please review the [coupons application
  scope](/coupons#application-scope).

## Create add-ons[](#create-add-ons "Direct link to heading")

To create an add-on through the user interface:

1. Access the **"Add-ons"** section via the side menu;
2. Click **"Add an add-on"**;
3. Choose a **name**, a **code** and a description (optional) for your add-on;
4. Define its value and currency; and
5. Click **"Add add-on"** to confirm.

## Assign an add-on to a customer[](#assign-an-add-on-to-a-customer "Direct link to heading")

Here is what you should know about add-ons:

- If the currency of the customer is already defined, the currency of the add-on
  must be the same; and
- You can apply an add-on to a customer as many times as you want.

To apply an add-on to a customer:

1. Select a customer from the list;
2. Click **"Actions"** in the upper-right corner and select **"Apply add-on"**;
3. Select an add-on from the list; and
4. Click **"Apply add-on"** to confirm.

Obviously, you can also apply add-ons via the API
([learn more](/api/add-ons/apply)).

### Application scope[](#application-scope "Direct link to heading")

Add-ons are one-off fees that are invoiced immediately. You can apply the same
add-on to a customer **as many times as you want**.

When assigning an add-on to a customer, you can **change the amount and
currency**.

<Tip>
This allows you to apply the same add-on to several customers whose
subscriptions don't have the same currency, or to apply a different amount for
one of these customers.

When using the API endpoint, if the amount and currency are null, Lago will
apply the default amount and currency defined in the UI.

</Tip>

## Edit and delete add-ons[](#edit-and-delete-add-ons "Direct link to heading")

In the add-ons section, you can click the **ellipsis icon** to see all available
actions:

1. **Edit**: allows you to modify the name, code, description and settings of
   the add-on;
2. **Delete**: allows you to delete the add-on and remove it from the list (this
   action cannot be undone).

<Info>
  You **cannot** edit or delete an add-on if it has been applied to a customer.
</Info>

## Invoicing[](#invoicing "Direct link to heading")

As mentioned previously, an **add-on is invoiced straight away**. You are able
to find an assigned add-on through webhook with
`webhook_type = invoice.add_on_added`.

When assiging an add-on to a customer, an invoice is generated immediately.
Please note that:

1. Add-ons are subject to taxes, as defined in the customer view; and
2. Coupons cannot be deducted from the amount of the add-on.
