apply prices to this usage."

Note that you don't need to define a Billable metric to create a Plan. However,
if you have usage feature to charge, the price of your Billable metrics is
defined inside each Plan. Make sure to understand
[how to create a Billable metric](/overview) first.

## Plan structure[](#plan-structure "Direct link to heading")

A Plan defines the features your customers have access to, the prices paid to
access them and the invoicing cadence. In order to invoice a Customer with Lago,
you must assign a Plan to a customer.

**But first, let's define the structure of a Plan:**

1. [The Plan basic informations](#plan-structure)
   - A Plan `name`
   - A Plan `code`
   - A Plan `description`
2. [The Plan model](/plans/plan-model)
   - A Plan `interval`
   - A Plan base `amount` with the `currency`
   - Boolean to define if the Plan is `pay in advance`
   - A Plan `trial period` in days
3. [The additional charges](/plans/charges) for this Plan (any Billable metrics
   that have been created)
   - A Charge `model`
   - A Charge `amount` and its `currency` (automatically inherited from the
     currency of the Plan)

<Info>
  All Plans and their charges **must be defined from the UI of the Lago
  application**.

## Editing and deleting Plans[](#editing-and-deleting-plans "Direct link to heading")

Plans can be edited and deleted only if they are not linked to a Customer
(meaning there is no active [subscription](/plans/subscriptions) for this Plan).

If you want to make a change to a Plan already linked to a Customer, you have 2
options:

1. Remove all active subscriptions
2. Create a new Plan
