description: "When setting up your pricing, you may want to group events according to their
property. To do so, you can create dimensions for your billable metric."

## Grouping with a single key[](#grouping-with-a-single-key "Direct link to heading")

Consider the following example:

> Your company provides DevOps services and you want to charge your customers
> for compute capacity by the hour.
>
> In your Lago account, you create a `compute` billable metric that calculates
> the total number of hours (i.e. `SUM(properties.hours)`).
>
> As your customers can choose from different cloud providers, you need to group
> usage records (i.e. events) according to the provider.
>
> On the configuration page of your billable metric, you can define
> `"key": "provider"` and `"value": ["AWS","Google","Azure"]` to create the
> corresponding dimension (see snippet below).

```json JSON snippet for one dimension
{
  "key": "provider",
  "values": ["AWS", "Google", "Azure"]
}
```

![Example of a group with one dimension](/images/dimensions-ae7422204710e5425289d69b7403a43c.png)

Below is an example of an event for the billable metric described above:

Event including a group value

```json Event including a group value
LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/events" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
      "event": {
          "transaction_id": "event_001",
          "external_customer_id": "customer_1234",
          "code": "compute",
          "timestamp": 1668461043,
          "properties": {
            "hours": 0.07,
            "provider": "Azure"
          }
      }
  }'
```

<Warning>
  Values are case-sensitive. If you don't use the exact value when pushing
  events, they will not be taken into account. Following our example: the
  expected value is `"Azure"` and `"azure"` is an invalid value.
</Warning>

## Grouping with two keys[](#grouping-with-two-keys "Direct link to heading")

It is also possible to define two levels for grouping events. Following our
previous example:

> In addition to their cloud provider, your customers can select their region.
>
> Therefore, you can define `"key": "region"` to add a second dimension (see
> snippet below).
>
> When creating a plan, you will then be able to add a [charge](/plans/charges)
> for each region available for each provider.

```json JSON snippet for two dimensions
{
  "key": "provider",
  "values": [
    {
      "name": "AWS",
      "key": "region",
      "values": ["Europe", "Africa", "Asia"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Google",
      "key": "region",
      "values": ["Europe", "North America"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Azure",
      "key": "region",
      "values": ["North America", "Asia"]
    }
  ]
}
```

See below a screenshot of the corresponding charge when added to a plan. The
same breakdown will be shown on the invoices sent to the customers.

Below is an example of an event for the billable metric described above:

Event including two group values

```json Event including two group values
LAGO_URL="https://api.getlago.com"
API_KEY="__YOUR_API_KEY__"

curl --location --request POST "$LAGO_URL/api/v1/events" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
      "event": {
          "transaction_id": "event_002",
          "external_customer_id": "customer_1234",
          "code": "compute",
          "timestamp": 1668461044,
          "properties": {
            "hours": 0.13,
            "provider": "AWS",
            "region": "Europe"
          }
      }
  }'

```

You can also create billable metrics with dimensions
[via the API](/api/billable-metrics/create).
