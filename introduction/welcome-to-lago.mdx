title: "Welcome to Lago"
description: "Lago is an open-source software for metering and usage-based billing. It's the best alternative to Chargebee, Recurly or Stripe Billing for companies that need to handle complex billing logics."
---

This library will allow you to build an entire billing system from scratch. Lago
is a real-time, event-based solution made for usage-based billing,
subscription-based billing, and all the nuances of pricing in between.

You can use the [self-hosted version](/docker) to deploy Lago on your existing
infrastructure or
[request access to Lago Cloud](https://forms.gle/eT7zgqcvq8dgt94g7) to start
using our solution immediately.

## Five-step billing workflow[](#five-step-billing-workflow "Direct link to heading")

### 1. Event ingestion[](#1-event-ingestion "Direct link to heading")

[Events](/ingesting-events) provide information about your customers'
consumption, with the highest level of granularity. Any product feature for
which you want to charge your customers should correspond to a specific event.
An event can be triggered by an action or can be sent periodically. Lago is able
to ingest events at scale while preventing duplicates.

### 2. Metrics aggregation[](#2-metrics-aggregation "Direct link to heading")

The aggregation process consists in converting events into
[billable metrics](/overview). There are 5 aggregation types:

| Aggregation       | Description                                                                      | Type      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `COUNT`           | Counts the number of times an incoming event occurs                              | Metered   |
| `SUM`             | Calculates the sum of a predefined property for incoming events                  | Metered   |
| `MAX`             | Returns the maximum value of a predefined property for incoming events           | Metered   |
| `COUNT DISTINCT`  | Returns the number of unique values of a predefined property for incoming events | Metered   |
| `RECURRING COUNT` | Add and remove billing units that are persisted period over period               | Persisted |

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Metered" icon="gauge-high">
    Aggregated for a single billing period and resume to 0 at the end of the
    billing period.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Persisted" icon="timer">
    Aggregated for a billing period and kept in-memory for following periods,
    unless you change the value.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Pricing[](#3-pricing "Direct link to heading")

Creating [plans](/plans/overview) allows you to define how much your customers
should pay for using your product. You can then combine plans and billable
metrics to implement any billing model (i.e. subscription-based, usage-based, or
hybrid). Billable metrics may be priced differently depending on the associated
plan.

### 4. Invoicing[](#4-invoicing "Direct link to heading")

Lago automatically generates [invoices](/invoicing/overview) for each customer
according to the plan model: the subscription fee can be billed at the beginning
or at the end of the billing period while usage-based charges are always
calculated at the end of the billing period. Invoices include fees, taxes and
customer information.

### 5. Payments[](#5-payments "Direct link to heading")

When an invoice is emitted and finalized, it's ready for payment collection.
Connect payment providers through [native integrations](/payments/overview) or
trigger payments on any PSPs using the invoice payload created by Lago.
